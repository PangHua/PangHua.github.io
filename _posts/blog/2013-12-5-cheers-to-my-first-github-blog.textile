Lately I tried to open up my own blog on some free productions, however they have some shortcomings more or less. Such as wordpress(blocked by the GW : (), quora.com(currently just a light blog with little features), csdn(server frequently hang...), finally I decide to set up my blog with github pages, blogging like a hacker :), pretty cool!

I make it by referring below links:

"GitHub help":https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles

"Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/

"ruanyifeng":http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2012/08/blogging_with_jekyll.html

"beiyuu":http://beiyuu.com/github-pages/ 

While the most import thing is to appreciate my best friend *TangChao*, who is always getting my back to let me be a deadbeat, Hahaha :)
